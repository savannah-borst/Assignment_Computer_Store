## Assignment
For the Assignment we had to build a dynamic web page using "vanilla" JavaScript. We had to build a computer store. Where you can select different kinds of computers, imported via API. Buy a computer or get a loan.

## How To Use
Go to the following website: https://savannah-borst.github.io/Assignment_Computer_Store/

Here you can click work to earn money. By clicking bank you transfer all your hard earned money to the bank. 

Once you have enough money on your bank you can select the computer you want and you can buy the computer.

You can get a loan (with restrictions). Once you have your loan you have to pay it off. This can be done by clicking the repay loan button or by transfering money to your bank(which will but 10% to pay the loan)
